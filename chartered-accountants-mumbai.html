<h1>NRI Taxation by <a href="http://www.mnpartners.in/">Chartered Accountants Mumbai</a></h1>
</p>
<p>There is a good amount of confusion concerning tax implication for NRIs that 
wish to sell any house property that they have in India. This article explores 
what proportion of tax is due and TDS deductible in case of NRIs wish to sell 
their property. </p>
<p>NRIs selling house property got to pay tax on the Capital Gains. The tax 
that's due on the profit depends on whether or not it’s a Short-term or 
Long-term capital gains. When a house property is sold, after a period of 2 
years (reduced from 3 years to 2 years in Budget 2017) from the date it was 
owned – then it is a long-term capital gain. In case it held for 2 years or less 
– then it is a short-term capital gain. &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tax implications for NRIs also are applicable in the case of 
inheritance</strong>. Keep in mind the date of purchase of the initial owner to 
decide whether or not it’s a long-term or Short-term financial gain. In such a 
case the value of the property shall be the value to the previous owner. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style5"><strong>How much tax is payable? </strong></p>
<p>Long-term capital gains are taxed at <strong>20%</strong> and Short-term 
gains shall be taxed at the applicable tax rates for the NRI. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style5"><strong>TDS Deductible </strong></p>
<p>When a NRI sells property, the <strong>Buyer</strong> is liable to deduct TDS 
@ 20%. And in case the property has been sold before two years (reduced from the 
date of purchase) a TDS of 30% shall be applicable. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style5"><strong>How to save tax on capital gains? </strong></p>
<p>NRIs are allowed to claim exemptions under section 54 and Section 54EC on 
long-term capital gains from sale of house property in India.</p>

&nbsp;

<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Exemption under Section 54 </strong></p>
<p>It is obtainable once there's a long-term financial gain on sale of a house 
property of the NRI. The house property can be self-occupied or let-out. Please 
note – you do <strong>NOT</strong> have to invest the enitre sale receipt,
<strong>only the amount of capital gains</strong>. Of course, your purchase 
price of the new property could be more than the amount of capital gains. 
However, your exemption shall be restricted to the overall financial gain on 
sale. </p>
<p>Also, you'll be able to purchase this property either one year before the 
sale or two years once the sale of your property. You're additionally allowed to 
invest the gains in under-construction property, however construction should be 
completed inside three years from the date of sale. &nbsp; </p>
<p>From 2014-15, it's been held that <strong>ONLY one house property </strong>
can be purchased or constructed from the capital gains to get this exemption.
</p>
<p>Additionally, beginning assessment year 2015-16 (or Financial Year 2014-15) 
it's obligatory that this new house property should be located in Republic of 
India. The exemption underneath section 54 shall not be obtainable for 
properties bought or made outside India. (Do keep in mind that this exemption is 
taken back if you sell this new property inside three years from the date of its 
purchase). &nbsp; </p>
<p>If you've NOT been able to invest your capital gains till the date of filing 
of return (usually 31st July – it got extended by one month this year) of the yr 
within which you've sold-out your property, you're allowed to deposit your gains 
in PSU bank or other banks as per the Capital Gains Account scheme, 1988. And in 
your return claim this as an exemption from your capital gains, then you don’t 
have to pay tax on it. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Exemption underneath section 54F</strong></p>
<p>It is available when there's a long-term capital gain on the sale of any 
capital asset other than a residential house. To get this exemption, the NRI 
needs to purchase one house property, within one year before the date of 
transfer or two years after the date of transfer. In case of construction of 
property, it should be within three years from the date of transfer of the 
asset. This new house property should be located in Republic of India and should 
not be sold-out within three years of its purchase or construction. &nbsp; Also, the 
NRI should not own more than one house property (besides the new house) and nor 
should the NRI purchase within a period of 2 years or construct within a period 
of 3 years any other residential house. Here the ENTIRE SALE receipts are 
required to be invested. If the entire sale receipts are invested, then the 
capital gains are fully exempt otherwise the exemption is allowed 
proportionately. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Additional Exemption under Section 54 EC</strong></p>
<p>You can also save the taxes on your long-term capital gains by investing them 
in certain bonds. Bonds issued by the <strong>National Highway Authority of 
India (NHAI)</strong> or <strong>Rural Electrification Corporation (REC)</strong> 
are specified for this purpose. These bonds are redeemable after three years and 
should not be sold-out before the lapse of three years from the date of sale of 
the house property. Note that you just cannot claim this investment underneath 
any other deduction. You're allowed a period of six months to invest in these 
bonds – (and make sure that you invest in them before the IT Return filing 
date). From 2015, you are allowed to invest a maximum of Rs fifty lakhs only in 
a financial year in these bonds. &nbsp; The NRI should make these investments and 
show relevant proofs to the Buyer of property – Escertain or make sure from the 
buyer of the property that he does not deduct TDS on the capital gains. The NRI 
can also claim excess TDS paid at the time of return filing and claim a refund.
